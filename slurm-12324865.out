Usage: qiime feature-table filter-features [OPTIONS]

  Filter features from table based on frequency and/or metadata. Any samples
  with a frequency of zero after feature filtering will also be removed.

Inputs:
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                         The feature table from which features should be
                         filtered.                                  [required]
Parameters:
  --p-min-frequency INTEGER
                         The minimum total frequency that a feature must have
                         to be retained.                          [default: 0]
  --p-max-frequency INTEGER
                         The maximum total frequency that a feature can have
                         to be retained. If no value is provided this will
                         default to infinity (i.e., no maximum frequency
                         filter will be applied).                   [optional]
  --p-min-samples INTEGER
                         The minimum number of samples that a feature must be
                         observed in to be retained.              [default: 0]
  --p-max-samples INTEGER
                         The maximum number of samples that a feature can be
                         observed in to be retained. If no value is provided
                         this will default to infinity (i.e., no maximum
                         sample filter will be applied).            [optional]
  --m-metadata-file METADATA...
    (multiple            Feature metadata used with `where` parameter when
     arguments will be   selecting features to retain, or with `exclude-ids`
     merged)             when selecting features to discard.        [optional]
  --p-where TEXT         SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata
                         criteria that must be met to be included in the
                         filtered feature table. If not provided, all features
                         in `metadata` that are also in the feature table will
                         be retained.                               [optional]
  --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                         If true, the features selected by `metadata` or
                         `where` parameters will be excluded from the filtered
                         table instead of being retained.     [default: False]
  --p-filter-empty-samples / --p-no-filter-empty-samples
                         If true, drop any samples where none of the retained
                         features are present.                 [default: True]
  --p-allow-empty-table / --p-no-allow-empty-table
                         If true, the filtered table may be empty. Default
                         behavior is to raise an error if the filtered table
                         is empty.                            [default: False]
Outputs:
  --o-filtered-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                         The resulting feature table filtered by feature.
                                                                    [required]
Miscellaneous:
  --output-dir PATH      Output unspecified results to a directory
  --verbose / --quiet    Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                         during execution of this action. Or silence output if
                         execution is successful (silence is golden).
  --example-data PATH    Write example data and exit.
  --citations            Show citations and exit.
  --use-cache DIRECTORY  Specify the cache to be used for the intermediate
                         work of this action. If not provided, the default

Usage: qiime feature-table filter-seqs [OPTIONS]

  Filter features from sequences based on a feature table or metadata. This
  method can filter based on ids in a table or a metadata file, but not both
  (i.e., the table and metadata options are mutually exclusive).

Inputs:
  --i-data ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence¹ | AlignedSequence²]
                         The sequences from which features should be
                         filtered.                                  [required]
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency]
                         Table containing feature ids used for id-based

     arguments will be   `where` parameter when selecting features to retain,
     merged)             or with `exclude-ids` when selecting features to
                         discard.                                   [optional]
  --p-where TEXT         SQLite WHERE clause specifying feature metadata
                         criteria that must be met to be included in the
                         filtered feature table. If not provided, all features
                         in `metadata` that are also in the sequences will be
                         retained.                                  [optional]
  --p-exclude-ids / --p-no-exclude-ids
                         If true, the features selected by the `metadata`
                         (with or without the `where` parameter) or `table`
                         parameter will be excluded from the filtered
                         sequences instead of being retained. [default: False]
Outputs:

Usage: qiime taxa filter-table [OPTIONS]

  This method filters features from a table based on their taxonomic
  annotations. Features can be retained in the resulting table by specifying
  one or more include search terms, and can be filtered out of the resulting
  table by specifying one or more exclude search terms. If both include and
  exclude are provided, the inclusion critera will be applied before the
  exclusion critera. Either include or exclude terms (or both) must be
  provided. Any samples that have a total frequency of zero after filtering
  will be removed from the resulting table.

Inputs:
  --i-table ARTIFACT FeatureTable[Frequency¹ | PresenceAbsence²]
                         Feature table to be filtered.              [required]
  --i-taxonomy ARTIFACT FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                         Taxonomic annotations for features in the provided
                         feature table. All features in the feature table must
                         have a corresponding taxonomic annotation. Taxonomic
                         annotations for features that are not present in the
                         feature table will be ignored.             [required]
Parameters:
  --p-include TEXT       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa
                         should be included in the resulting table. If
                         providing more than one term, terms should be
                         delimited by the query-delimiter character. By
                         default, all taxa will be included.        [optional]
  --p-exclude TEXT       One or more search terms that indicate which taxa
                         should be excluded from the resulting table. If
                         providing more than one term, terms should be
                         delimited by the query-delimiter character. By
                         default, no taxa will be excluded.         [optional]
  --p-query-delimiter TEXT
                         The string used to delimit multiple search terms
                         provided to include or exclude. This parameter should
                         only need to be modified if the default delimiter (a
                         comma) is used in the provided taxonomic annotations.
                                                                [default: ',']
  --p-mode TEXT Choices('exact', 'contains')
                         Mode for determining if a search term matches a
                         taxonomic annotation. "contains" requires that the
                         annotation has the term as a substring; "exact"
                         requires that the annotation is a perfect match to a
                         search term.                    [default: 'contains']
Outputs:

Usage: qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree [OPTIONS]

  This pipeline will start by creating a sequence alignment using MAFFT, after
  which any alignment columns that are phylogenetically uninformative or
  ambiguously aligned will be removed (masked). The resulting masked alignment
  will be used to infer a phylogenetic tree and then subsequently rooted at
  its midpoint. Output files from each step of the pipeline will be saved.
  This includes both the unmasked and masked MAFFT alignment from q2-alignment
  methods, and both the rooted and unrooted phylogenies from q2-phylogeny
  methods.

Inputs:
  --i-sequences ARTIFACT FeatureData[Sequence]
                          The sequences to be used for creating a fasttree
                          based rooted phylogenetic tree.           [required]
Parameters:
  --p-n-threads NTHREADS  The number of threads. (Use `auto` to automatically
                          use all available cores) This value is used when
                          aligning the sequences and creating the tree with
                          fasttree.                               [default: 1]
  --p-mask-max-gap-frequency PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                          The maximum relative frequency of gap characters in
                          a column for the column to be retained. This
                          relative frequency must be a number between 0.0 and
                          1.0 (inclusive), where 0.0 retains only those
                          columns without gap characters, and 1.0 retains all
                          columns  regardless of gap character frequency. This
                          value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
                                                                [default: 1.0]
  --p-mask-min-conservation PROPORTION Range(0, 1, inclusive_end=True)
                          The minimum relative frequency of at least one
                          non-gap character in a column for that column to be
                          retained. This relative frequency must be a number
                          between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). For example, if a
                          value of  0.4 is provided, a column will only be
                          retained  if it contains at least one character that
                          is present in at least 40% of the sequences. This
                          value is used when masking the aligned sequences.
                                                                [default: 0.4]
  --p-parttree / --p-no-parttree
                          This flag is required if the number of sequences
                          being aligned are larger than 1000000. Disabled by
                          default.                            [default: False]

  --o-masked-alignment ARTIFACT FeatureData[AlignedSequence]
                          The masked alignment.                     [required]
  --o-tree ARTIFACT       The unrooted phylogenetic tree.
    Phylogeny[Unrooted]                                             [required]
  --o-rooted-tree ARTIFACT
    Phylogeny[Rooted]     The rooted phylogenetic tree.             [required]
Miscellaneous:
  --output-dir PATH       Output unspecified results to a directory
  --verbose / --quiet     Display verbose output to stdout and/or stderr
                          during execution of this action. Or silence output
                          if execution is successful (silence is golden).
  --recycle-pool TEXT     Use a cache pool for pipeline resumption. QIIME 2
                          will cache your results in this pool for reuse by
                          future invocations. These pool are retained until
                          deleted by the user. If not provided, QIIME 2 will
                          create a pool which is automatically reused by
                          invocations of the same action and removed if the
                          action is successful. Note: these pools are local to
                          the cache you are using.
  --no-recycle            Do not recycle results from a previous failed
                          pipeline run or save the results from this run for
                          future recycling.
  --parallel              Execute your action in parallel. This flag will use
                          your default parallel config.
  --parallel-config FILE  Execute your action in parallel using a config at
                          the indicated path.
  --example-data PATH     Write example data and exit.
  --citations             Show citations and exit.
